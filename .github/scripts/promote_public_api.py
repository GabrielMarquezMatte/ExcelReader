"""Moves every entry out of each PublicAPI.Unshipped.txt into its PublicAPI.Shipped.txt.

Run after a release ships: everything that was "unshipped" at release time is now part of
the public API contract. Operates on every TFM folder under src/*/PublicAPI/*/.

Exit codes: 0 = promoted something, 2 = nothing needed promoting (not an error — the caller
skips the rest of the job), 1 = an actual failure (an uncaught exception, same as Python's
default for any unhandled error). 2 is deliberately not 1 - an uncaught exception used
to exit 1 exactly like the intentional "nothing to promote" case, so release.yml's `if
python3 ...; then changed=true; else changed=false; fi` silently treated a crash (missing
file, permission error) the same as a no-op success, disarming the next release's
breaking-change detection instead of failing the job.
